# neural-network-currency

This clojure project is for testing neural network ability to predict future currency value with input for NN currency values from past.

## Testing

Purpose of this application is to test ANN (Artificial Neural Network) ability to predict currency value in future. I will try predicting for some currencies with ANN and compare it with random generator to test it.

### Results

Not yet made.

## Using

 - Historical currency converter web service http://currencies.apps.grandtrunk.net/ - for getting currency values
 - https://github.com/gigasquid/k9.git - for ANN
